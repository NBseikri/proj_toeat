Delicious food. Fun drinks and bartenders. Really cool acts. Perfect for fun night out, date, drinks with friends. There is a resident tarot card reader named Eugenia who is a Seattle treasure. Highly recommend this place!|Absolutely delicious!! I saw this place on Yelp an wanted to give it a try. I'm a vegetarian and they have a few options or us folks! I ate the lasagna and the noodles literally melted in my mouth. If your down town Seattle and you want a place elegance and wonderful ambiance, look no further!|Fantastic fish! Excellent patio with view of the bay! Incredible bread! We came for a late lunch and I plan on returning for the dinner experience!  Tricky to find.. inside the building and upstairs to the Pink Door. lol|First trip to Seattle- this place was a great choice for dinner on our first night in town. Lasagna was fantastic, and the meat and cheese plate was amazing. Great choice.|Excellent excellent Italian restaurant! Cozy and romantic setting inside, and an amazing patio looking over the waterfront! For cocktail, I had Baby & Co which was just right amount of sweetness and bubbles. For dinner, I tried their risotto which changes seasonally - they currently have crabmeat risotto. It was very light and delicious! |	2016-11-14 04:33:53.989719

What kind of demon would I have to br to NOT rate this place 5 stars after that kind of love? One without a soul, that's what kind. Oh, it was ridiculicious, too.|Absolutely love both Hot Cakes locations! Fresh Minimal ingredient Chocolate Molten Cakes with Vegan options! Love their Boozy milkshakes! Everytime we have visitors we take them to Hot Cakes. The Capitol Hill location has more seating than Ballard but quality is the same. |I am definitely a chocolate lover. The molten chocolate cake is just ok. Dont know why it is so famous. But in general, the store is very good for a friends hang out for young people.|It was crowded, with the line to order food pouring out on to the street, so you know it's good. We ordered almost everything off the menu to sample and it was all delicious. My favorites were the chocolate pannini and the chocolate pudding but the menu changes regularly so I'm sure each visit would be a new experience. A new favorite dessert spot! |Pretty good place for a stop, but maybe a little expensive for what you get. The drinks are good, but not as good as the prices would make you hope for.|	2016-11-14 04:39:11.916067

A lot of reviewers said if you don't go when it opens you won't get the best one, but we were there at around 10:30 and still enjoyed it!\n\nThey don't have too many seats. It's pretty much of a pick-up store where u order and go.\n\nThey don't have too many drinks options either, so if u want some drinks you will probably need to go somewhere else.\n\nBut the taste worths your visit!|It's a tiny little place that houses a lot of deliciousness. \n\nThere is usually a crowd in here as if they're not using the very limited standing room to tuck into treats then they are taking photos with the infamous 'I got baked in SF' sign. \n\nThe baked goods themselves are wonderful, we bought a few things including the ube puff, coffee cream bomb among others and everything was amazing. They're really good at what they do and their popularity is well earned. \n\nIf you have time, it is well worth the trip!|Cool bakery, but you probably don't wanna stay here too long since it's incredibly cozy. Best for a quick trip and to enjoy elsewhere. I particularly enjoyed the kouign amann. They have a rotating menu all of which are great! Definitely worth checking out! |Preferred the kouign-amann more than the cruffin which was too sweet for me|My favorite spot when I visit the fam-bam!  The absolute best custard filled doughnuts in the world- NO UNIVERSE lol\nThey are amazing regardless what you order  My brother loves the carmel rolls.

Made with liquid nitrogen, it seems to be very hyped. Doesn't disappoint! One thing that was odd.. We can can't mix flavors even in a regular scoop. Otherwise we could have tried two flavors. |Think you have had good ice-cream?\nThink again.\n\nThis place gives Berthillion on isle st Lois in Paris a run for their money. Never thought it possible.\n\nCookie dough is amazing. \n\nIt is all smooth and creamy because it's made a la minute with liquid nitrogen.\n|The TCHO was amazing with the spiced caramel! Definitely something new and worth trying! Ice cream was great! Very rich and creamy with a nice smooth texture! Another good flavor is the salted caramel!|Earl Grey is good! But I recommend you get small size if you are alone. After having 3 balls of them, I don't feel that good anymore.|Icecream was okay. It's nice, definitely. But in my honest opinion not worth the hype amd queues (if any long ones). They make the icecream fresh, so you can see them while they're pumping liquid nitrogen into the milk while mixing everything together. |	2016-11-15 20:22:19.830032

Amazing food and lemonade! Parking is a bit hard to find though.|Very good food. Price is reasonable. Health food should always taste this good!|Ofcourse this place has many choices in lemonade. However they also have alot of healthy food choices. Usually crowded, but alot better then all the other fast food restaurants.|I love the cafeteria concept and the free samples. Staff is friendly and price is okay for the food you're getting. Stopped in for a lemonade, Mac and cheese and a macaroon. Lemonade was please, I think I mixed two and have the blueberry guava one. In the end it was too sweet and started drying out my throat/ still overall I liked it and would give a 2.5-3 out of 5. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the consistency was too mushy for my liking. The macaron was okay. The filling was not solid enough so it didn't hold the cookies and I think the cookies were slightly too thick. But I do enjoy the size of the macaron. Overall, sweet little spot to spot and get a drink and a little bit. Nothing mind blowing|	2016-11-15 20:22:49.702521

They definitely get comfort food right.\n\nThis was recommended to me several times and I'm super glad we opted to give the brunch a shot.\n\nFood was phenomenal and feeling. Coffee was great (as expected). Ended up sitting at the bar since the wait was long, but it was a lot of fun and our server was friendly despite the business. I was super impressed by their ability to handle such high traffic. \n\nHighly recommended for brunch |I liked this place.  It could've used a deeper menu, but I think it's somewhat seasonal.  The portions were decent and they put together some interesting stuff. I'd recommend this place for the aspiring foodie.  It's fun food that tries some different combinations if you want to try something only a little outside the box before becoming more adventurous. \n\nI believe this place started as a food truck and I can totally see that in their menu and attitude.  And that's a compliment, not a knock.  It feels fun and authentic to their perspective.  \n\nEverything was fresh, fairly fast, and well prepared.  Their cocktails were also good.|My first time here I was hung over and the greasy/gourmet/diner food hit the spot.  I was so excited to see such good diner food I never really paid attention to the price.  First time around I ordered the PB & J with bananas AND the grilled cheese sandwich with a side of poutine.  I know i'm fat. don't judge.  Paid the bill and didn't think anything of it.  \n\nThe second time I came, I had the pork belly.  And the third time I brought my gf and I had the mac n cheese and she had a salad and a milk shake. \n\nIt wasn't til the 3rd time I came here did I notice the prices.  I realized then I paid $10 for a PB & J, $9 for a grilled cheese... sheesh... pricey...  I don't remember the pork belly price because I was shocked that a salad, milk shake, and mac n cheese costed my $52.  \n\nIs the food good?  Yes, it was all very delicious... is it worth the price tag? hardly so.  For that kind of money I would rather have a fancy dinner... not have just fancy diner.|It's a very good American style cafe. The coffee, food and drinks are just fine. The Chicken Sammy is about the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. Some of the portions of the dishes are way too big so go with friends and share or stick with the sandwiches and salad. I don't like spending so much on three times as much food as I can eat in one sitting.|Love this place! They certainly know their meats. Their apple butter pork chop is amazing and mention the chub is the best.\n\nDefinitely suggest you check this place out.|	2016-11-16 20:15:03.849415

Loved the crispy onion and tender pork they put in.The unending was also very good.Service was extremely friendly and generous.I'm a fan.Truly excited that I have a new place to go to with my family.|Love this little sushi restaurant, reasonable priced and food quality is great. Love their Omakase Sashimi set, (chef prepared sashimi) well displayed with 12 different kind of fish, some of them you can't get at other restaurants, it was so delicious, totally worth the price I am paying ($45) too had this place is so small it fills up quick, have to wait in line for 30 minutes before we can get our table, but it was worth the wait.|I had lunch with my wife and mother-in-law a few months ago. The service was very slow, and they were very inattentive. I am not sure why. The food was good but the inattentiveness was disappointing. |Delightful!

Hells yeah. \n\n* Braised Short Rib "Hash" - Not so much a hash as it was a quinoa and potato bowl topped with a poached egg and fall off the bone tender rib deliciousness.\n\nCute little brunch spot, with a simple, but fantastic color scheme, and a combination of indoor and outdoor seating. Oh, and my favorite part? They take reservations. For brunch. WIN!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - We were seated on the border of their in/outdoor seating, so I didn't pay too much attention to the interior seating arrangement. If memory serves me, I remember the place being a little on the smaller side, with the border seating actually being the best option. That said, my end of the table was on a slight decline backwards, which made for slightly awkward seating. \n\nBathroom - Didn't try.|Great food with diverse culinary backgrounds. I enjoy the food both as a fine taste and as an art, even. I've had a couple meals before; most recently, I had the Mr & Mrs Croque sandwich, bread and contents toasted together in a coherent yet fluid sensation. Highly recommend if nearby. |I had just landed in San Francisco an hour before me and my friend (from Vancouver) ate here -- we were extremely hungry. We were staying in the Richmond District so we quickly yelped breakfast spots around the neighbourhood where we could walk to; Cassava was recommended. \n\nWhen we got there, I spent at least 10 minutes deciding against their brunch menu or the Randwich. I asked the server which one she liked better and she told me that the Randwich was a messy favourite. She did not lie. \n\nWith my last name also being "Rand", I truly feel like my life changed after eating this sandwich. I took an uber home from the bar later that evening and was told that I spent 15 minutes drunk-explaining my love for this sandwich. It's THAT good. \n\n10/10 Recommend.|	2016-11-17 01:41:39.637431

The owner is even behind the counter cooking and is happy to chat about the restaurant, the food, or whatever. Food is delicious, won’t disappoint you.

Will definitely be back again.|Expensive with small portion of food. but with nice decorated environment. Good for couples|Please Note: La Serre is split into the fine dinning restaurant on the top floor and bakery on the lower floor, this is a review of the lower floor bakery.\n\nThis is actually one of my favorite restaurants in Dubai.  In the morning they service what I consider to be the best breakfast in Downtown, this can be further seen by the fact that by 10 am the on the weekend the place is packed and you will be required to wait for a table.  Their coffee and tea selection is very good as are the breakfast dishes they serve.  During the winter they offer outdoor seating on the Boulevard in addition to indoor seating where one can watch their kitchen team creating the dishes.  They have plenty of attentive waiting staff and the service is accurate and very swift, even when they are busy.  My principle complaint regard this establishment is the cost of dishes and the portion size.  All their dishes, including the coffee, are above average in terms of cost yet they does not translate into portion size.  Although, I do love the food, I rarely leave feeling full always feeling they could be more generous especially when one considers the cost they are charging.  What I will say though, is that this is one of the most consistent restaurants in Dubai.  Dishes always look and taste the same, a feat that many restaurants in Dubai cannot even come close too.|One of the best pastas i have had so far.. located in down town with a great view.. looking froward to my next visit..|I have been coming to this restaurant almost every month to hold client meetings.

The other courses were good, and the dessert was good too; but I expected the Paella to be the winning dish. Furthermore, the service was not great. It took us a really long time to get water; we had to ask twice and still waited after that. |We went there for paella. Service was great. Food is of good quality.

The Big Woody (1/3 lb. Burger with cheddar cheese, bacon lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles ketchup and mayo) is my favorite. They play decent music, and the atmosphere is chill. Check them out when you can.|Honestly not sure how this place has so many positive reviews. The food was OK, but very underwhelming for the price you pay. \n\nBurgers had good toppings, but they had more salt then I've ever had on a burger. They meat was way over cooked. There is a lot of potential, but they failed to deliver in terms of actual cooking of the meet. \n\nThe sides were huge. We got a side of fries and it was an entire basket. The onion rings were probably an entire onion. The problem though is that they tasted like they were soaked in grease instead of being properly cooked. The onion rings were not very crisp, so probably not too fresh. \n\nThe place has an interesting decor and nice vibe. The bathroom is pretty disgusting, but fortunately you can see the kitchen and it looked clean. \n\nVery underwhelming and not deserving of the current 4.4 star rating on Google. |Good burgers and fries, the special (Beecher's mac&cheese burger) was delicious.

There is no real "dining area" save a few folding tables attached to the wall but you would not want to eat there as lobby is typically packed like sardines.

You definitely fill up quickly on the poke. Avocado's probably not worth it - it wasn't a great avocado, kind of underripe. The staff was really friendly too. One thing I didn't like was that drivers parking in the lot end up shining their headlights right into the restaurant at patrons. Otherwise, decent venue.|My third time being there and trying to go through their menu selection one by one.  Food is very good though it takes a bit of time getting.  Very friendly and good looking waitstaff.  Fun atmosphere and they offer a parking lot so always a good thing.  I will return many times.|So happy that Poke to the Max has it's brick-and-mortar location in the neighborhood. Prices are reasonable, food is fresh and delicious, service is great! I'm a huge fan of their reconstructed musubi, which is really just a spam musubi re-imagined in roll form. Messy but oh-so-delicious! Check it out. :)|Very awesome food, the fish was delicious. It was quick, reasonably priced, and I liked the feel of the place (good music too).|Incredible poke! If you like fish, but have not yet had the pleasure of trying poke (pronounced "po-kay), do yourself a favor and try Sam Choy's.

Had the skirt steak sandwich and one order made as a salad. The skirt steak was grilled to a perfect medium rare with a nice char that made it incredibly good. It appears that they use a wood-fire grill. The steak was of high quality. It was flavorful, tender and we couldn't get enough. Can't wait to try other things. (Note: We sat at the raw bar which appeared to have a few things you'd find at a sushi bar, but wouldn't call this a sushi bar.  However, the raw bar has some remarkable-looking food.)|If I could give them a higher rating I TOTALLY would!!!! \nservice was excellent, the place was beautiful atmosphere just perfect, I chose this place for my last night in Seattle.

The truffle sausage special was a flavor we've never experienced, the gnocchi was perfectly sized and cooked, and their bologna sauce was the tastiest red sauce we've ever tried.It was also fun to listen to all the staff talk with their Italian accents and sometimes in Italian to each other as well. Five stars hands down.|Sounds is amazing. We've been twice now and each time, the dishes were inventive, seasonal and delicious. It's pricey, but worth it and great small menu so you can go with a group and try everything. The simple pasta with butter and sage is out of this world!|Incredible pasta! You can even watch as they make the pasta. Very delicious but fairly pricy.|Seattle has a lot of great restaurants but Spinasse was the highlight of our trip. It is a Northern Italian restaurant so the menu is hearty. My boyfriend is from Mlian and he said this place could easily be a successful restaurant in Italy. The pastas were unbelievable, so even though there are so many delish starters to try, save room for the main attraction. We loved the prosciutto starter, which could easily feed 5 people, and the stuffed zucchini blossoms. If you can get a reservation, Spinasse is a must!|A wonderful family-style dining experience.

The food service is an exquisite balance of art, seasonally optimal ingredients and flavor. The wine service is nothing short of incredible, offering bespoke pairings and variety to suit all pallets. I was recently asked if the experience was worth the investment. My answer was an undoubtedly "Yes." If you are considering a two or three star Michelin restaurant, Atelier Crenn should be at the the top of your list for SF, and the Bay Area. |This restaurant is by far my favorite in San Francisco.

Overall Quite a bit different atmosphere from other Paris restaurants which I have eaten with single Michelin stars, I think they are getting extra credit for being different.. was hipster just as that started to be a thing.. |Didn't feel the creativity and quality of the dishes lived up to its hype (world's 50 best and michelin star). Main course of quail with blackberry was not that inspiring and just as commonplace as similar pairing of poultry and berry fruit found in states. Another main course has perfectly cooked fish but overwhelmed by accompanied herbs. Didn't feel like the quality of the ingredients gets to shine through after the manipulation.|Note that this review is for Clamato, the restaurant next door to Septime and under the same management. For some reason this restaurant does not appear on Google maps yet. Unlike Septime, Clamato does not take reservations and the focus is entirely on seafood. It's also a la carte. This was one of the best meals we had in Paris. Incredibly fresh, bright flavors enlivened but not overwhelmed by intriguing seasonings such as the paprika with the cooked mussels served chilled out of the shell. Arrive early if you want a seat. A great consolation if you can't get a seat at Septime. |The Michelin Star chef Bertrand is just amazing. One of the best table I ever eat at|	2016-11-22 07:43:38.844022

Yes, this place is expensive, but you get your money's worth. . . beyond the food and drinks, the ambiance and service are both stellar. This is an ideal place for an anniversary or a special date. You can also get a taste of the good life during their happy hour, from 5:30 to 6:30 at the bar. They have specials on their house red and white wine, a lager, and a rotating specialty cocktail. On top of that, all of their appetizers are half off (they're listed as "cold dishes"and "hot dishes"). The portions are small, but that's to be expected somewhere as fancy as this. We listened to the recommendations of our excellent bartender, Katie, and had the mushroom risotto, the nectarine gazpacho, the steelhead sushi roll, and the octopus--and each one was a hit! Honestly, we were thrilled with every aspect of our experience. I'll confess that as a former bartender and server I can be a little hard to impress when it comes to customer service, but Katie was definitely impressive! L'Abattoir was the culinary highlight of our week in Vancouver. |Really a special place. We dined here twice (dinner & brunch). Both meals were outstanding. The dining area in the back looks out on the bricks of the old jail house courtyard. Service was impeccable and the food well thought out and executed. |Go here every time I can when visiting from Victoria. This little gem in Gastown, Vancouver has beautifully crafted drinks and a creative dinner menu. Everything is really good in quality. Yes, this place is expensive, but it's totally worth going every time I visit. The menu changes quite frequently. Nice urban-rustic-chic atmosphere.|As a vegetarian there's not a whole lot on the menu I can eat, but the cocktails are fantastic. I go back repeatedly when waiting for restaurants in the area as there are usually spots at the bar and they have a great selection of drinks. It's a really nice space and the staff are very friendly.|A perennial favourite for casual fine dining. Completely unpretentious, but impeccable service in a beautiful space - get a table in the rear atrium for a more secluded, quiet dinner. Beautiful plates of impeccable-quality and inventive food, with a great cocktail and wine menu to go with it.|	2016-11-22 07:53:08.358744

The Nutella banana pancakes were tasty but not divine. If you worship pancakes then you will adore this holy mountain of flapjacks. For others, the rest of healthy American-style menu has something for everyone from Cobb salads to classic diner sandwiches. Good price. Good portions. Friendly service. |The food is wonderfully creative and seems to be healthy. You ABSOLUTELY have to try the pancakes (triple berry cheesecake is my favorite).  I wouldn't go just for the bloody Mary's or mimosas. They are a little pricey but the food is delicious|Always very hard to get a seat, but for good reason. Food is amazing with a ton of great choices. They will be very accomodating to you on portion size as well, and will price accordingly... (Say they have an order of special pancakes, you can get 1 instead of 3)|Most people come here for breakfast and it's great but a little secret...the lunches are really good as well. They sell a Greek salad with chicken as a half salad for $9.50 that is truly one of the best deals in the area. Big, fresh and healthy. Check it out|Standard brunch place. I really didn't find anything that special about the food. Standard run of the mil brunch fare. Service was fast which was nice!|	2016-11-22 07:54:43.96126
