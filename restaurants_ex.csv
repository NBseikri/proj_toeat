We went for my wife's birthday and she LOVED it (and she is vegan and gluten free). They had no problem accommodating her preference. It's a bit pricey for what it is, but the paella was very very flavorful. We had a great time, and the service was very good.|This place had amazing tapas and great sangria. We tried several dishes and they were all fantastic. The service was also great. Enjoy! |I had a lukewarm experience here. There is a sign out front that says wait to be seated, but no one really checks on it. So if you fallow the sign you'll be waiting for ever. Once you get a table service is fast, but don't expect much in the way of spicy Spanish food. Tango is in a good location and has some very nice views, that's probably what makes it a nice place to stop. Happy hour beer prices are also very reasonable.|Excellent food and a cozy feel make it great to share some bites and drinks with friends. |Great place for tapas and drinks. Something for just about everyone, who isn't vegetarian or vegan. Less options for them, but they do have a few.|Very good paella.

From late night runs after work to midday meals - Dick's is delicious. I would like to say that my absolute favorite thing about Dick's are the MILKSHAKES. Holy smokes! They are literally the best milkshakes I have ever had. No questions!|I really like Dick's for how quick you get your food and how late its open. But the quality isn't much better than your local school cafeteria or even McDonald's. I'd recommend red mill if you aren't in a rush. |Very good, cheap food. Crummy parking lot.If you're looking for high brow eats, this isn't the place for you. If you want American classics done right, you're at the right place.|Classic ""old skool"" burgers. Fast and reliable. Dick's has a great employment scheme, pays their people properly, provides assistance for students.  All round a place worth supporting..... AND the burgers and fries are GOOD !!!:-)|I loved them & we're faithfully. I'd come to Seattle once a month for work & eat there every day when I was in town. Always at different times cause I work on call, so my schedule is nuts. I'd spend about $15-$20 bucks a day but tonight? I'd bought 2 burgers earlier & was called in to work. I wasn't able to eat them so came back with my 2 giant burgess asking if I could at least have 2 of their smallest cause I was afraid to get sick. I offered to spend another $15 if the manager would replace my giant burgers with small ones but the Manager was all business... I guess. Technically she would have still made $10 if she replaced them & I spent there but she said no so I went to spend my money elswhere. Disappointed cause I love the food but if they don't honor regulars even if they will MAKE MONEY FROM IT...I'm done. Dominoes it is. They're only a block down & instead of the $15 I was gonna spend I'll grab 2 medium pizzas & eat for 2 days. Your loss.|",2-Nov-16

Those beignets..Nom Nom Nom :) I've been here for dinner and brunch and I can't say enough good things.. The food was amazing, the service was great! We ordered the scallops and steak frites for our main course and the crab beignets to start and of course the dessert beignets to end our meal.. The only thing I will say is that if you're going to have more than 3 people in your party, you will want to double up on apps and desserts :) we also got to meet the chef when we went for brunch and it was so refreshing to see him walk around his restaurant and interact with everyone!|Food was ok. Waiter was an absolute jerk. Sean. Rude and condescending. Perhaps because we had children. Or maybe just a bad day. Either way, customer service like that leaves a bad taste...|My wife and spent Sunday, Gay Pride parade day, at the Sheraton.  We currently are between houses and wanted to get away from all the business hassles.  The extraordinary parade and joyful atmosphere were great,  but particularly the meal and our wonderful waiter really made the day.  We had a variety of excellent small dishes and I asked the waiter to recommend a wine that might best fit this array.  Over the next nearly 2 hours he brought us several 3 ounce servings that each time enhanced the food. His conversation was always appropriate and never intrusive. The atmosphere was perfect, the food great, and,damm I forgot his name made the biggest difference. The next time we spend a weekend in Seattle, and we do a few times each year...Loulay will be on our list |An excellent restaurant, very friendly staff, great atmosphere,  the food made me feel like I was back in Europe, and Chef came by to say hi , we couldn't ask for better service. |Great first courses, as billed. Featured halibut overcooked, replacement halibut dish unseasoned and still overcooked. Can we just get some decent properly cooked fish, folks?|",2-Nov-16

Share a plate of their popular chicken wings with friends over unique cocktails with Asian flare. The venue is small but stays true to the ""rags to riches"" story of Pok Pok. Due to popularity and limited seating, arrive early to reserve a table. Takeout and delivery is available.|We had a great dinner here with friends. We ordered the chicken wings, boar collar and the duck. There were a couple of other dishes as well that I did not order so they have escaped my memory. The food was delicious we would return. Loved the collards with the boar collar to cut the spice. |Holy crow, this place was wonderful. My friend who lived in Southeast Asia for a year says that this is some of the most authentic stuff she's had on this side of the ocean. Treat yourself and don't forget to order a drinking vinegar (the lychee flavor is spectacular).|Not worth all the waiting in line! My friend and I tried to come for dinner, but it was over 2 hour wait. We came back the next day for lunch and didn't have to wait at all. I had the khao soi. It was good. I thought their cocktails were a little overpriced.|Lived up to the hype. Fantastic wings. Although I can't remember the names of everything else to save my life, there is nothing here I wouldn't recommend. Small but solid drink list too. Cool ambiance.  Nice service. A little pricey but definitely some interesting flavors. Worth a visit.",2-Nov-16

I loved it. I suggest you make reservation or show up when they open to get a table. |Wow the food is good here. I went for an event. There were a lot of selections considering the size of the event. I had seared tuna for dinner and the desert was a cheesecake and it was amazing. The only drawback was that the large room we were in had acoustics that made it hard to hear people.|This place has such a romantic vibe. Definitely call ahead an ask to be seated in the ""outside"" area. Everything on the menu is delicious and their wine list extensive with a lot of unique offerings. The warm brandade gratin was one of my personal favorite starters.|Got to cross this place off my bookmarks a few weeks ago with a group of friends, coming in for a late 2:15pm brunch, and having to wait almost until 3pm to be seated.Finally seated, I ordered their crispy duck leg confit, and also got to try the pop tart and French toast that others at the table ordered. And, all in all, I wasn't too terribly impressed, with everything being pretty average, having had better versions of everything except the pop tart elsewhere.Now, if we were just rating based on food, I'd give Foreign Cinema 3 stars. But given the price of the food, I'd much rather spend my money on some tastier and more affordable brunch options elsewhere in the city.***Accessibility Info***Venue - Open and spacious, so accessibility isn't an issue.Bathroom - Accessible, though not the nicest (and in odd contrast with the rest of the venue).|Food was good but they took too long to bring the plates after we ordered.
